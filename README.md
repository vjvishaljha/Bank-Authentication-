# Bank-Authentication-
Data were extracted from images that were taken for the evaluation of an authentication procedure for banknotes.
	We'll use the Bank Authentication Data Set from the UCI repository.

The data consists of 5 columns:

    variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
    skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
    curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
    entropy of image (continuous)
    class (integer)

Where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic.

We are trying to predict whether the Bank note is original or not using Tensorflow 

The dataset can be downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository
